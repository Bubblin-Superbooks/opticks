When the first Prism ABC is turned about its Axis according to the order of the Letters ABC, the Rays MH emerge more and more obliquely out of that Prism, and at length after their most oblique Emergence are reflected towards N, and going on to <em>p</em> do increase the Number of the  Rays N_p_. Afterwards by continuing the Motion of the first Prism, the Rays MG are also reflected to N and increase the number of the Rays N_t_. And therefore the Light MN admits into its Composition, first the more refrangible Rays, and then the less refrangible Rays, and yet after this Composition is of the same Nature with the Sun's immediate Light FM, the Reflexion of the specular Base BC causing no Alteration therein.</p></div> </div>
