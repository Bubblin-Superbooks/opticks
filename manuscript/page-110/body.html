For then the Light N_p_ which in the fourth Prism is more refracted, will become fuller and stronger when the Light OP, which in the third Prism HJK is more refracted, vanishes at P; and afterwards when the less refracted Light OT vanishes at T, the less refracted Light N_t_ will become increased whilst the more refracted Light at <em>p</em> receives no farther increase. And as the trajected beam MO in vanishing is always of such a Colour as ought to result from the mixture of the  Colours which fall upon the Paper PT, so is the reflected beam MN always of such a Colour as ought to</p></div> </div>
