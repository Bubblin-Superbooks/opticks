<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p><em>In a Letter written to Mr.</em> Leibnitz <em>in the year 1679, and published by Dr.</em> Wallis, <em>I mention'd a Method by which I had found some general Theorems about squaring Curvilinear Figures, or comparing them with the Conic Sections, or other the simplest Figures with which they may be compared. And some Years ago I lent out a Manuscript containing such Theorems, and having since met with some Things copied out of it, I have on this Occasion made it publick, prefixing to it an</em> Introduction, <em>and subjoining a</em> Scholium <em>concerning that Method. And I have joined with it another small Tract concerning the Curvilinear Figures of the Second Kind, which was also written many Years ago, and made known to some Friends, who have solicited the making it publick.</em></p><p><em>I.
