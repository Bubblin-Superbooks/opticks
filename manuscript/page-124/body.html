By this means I made the Breadth of the Image <em>pt</em> to be forty times, and sometimes sixty or seventy times less than its Length. As for instance, if the Breadth of the Hole F be one tenth of an Inch, and MF the distance of the Lens from the Hole be 12 Feet; and if <em>p</em>B or <em>p</em>M the distance of the Image <em>pt</em> from the Prism or Lens be 10 Feet, and the refracting Angle of the Prism be 62  Degrees, the Breadth of the Image <em>pt</em> will be one twelfth of an Inch, and the Length about six Inches, and therefore the Length to the Breadth as 72 to 1, and by consequence the Light of this Image 71 times less compound than the Sun's direct Light. And Light thus far simple and homogeneal, is sufficient for trying all the Experiments in this Book about simple Light.</p></div> </div>
