For by this means, if the Axis of the Prism be parallel to the Perpendicular of the Triangle, the Image <em>pt</em> [in <em>Fig.</em> 25.] will now be form'd of equicrural Triangles <em>ag</em>, <em>bh</em>, <em>ci</em>, <em>dk</em>, <em>el</em>, <em>fm</em>, &c. and innumerable other intermediate ones answering  to the triangular Hole in Shape and Bigness, and lying one after another in a continual Series between two Parallel Lines <em>af</em> and <em>gm</em>. These Triangles are a little intermingled at their Bases, but not at their Vertices; and therefore the Light on the brighter Side <em>af</em> of the Image, where the Bases of the Triangles are, is a little compounded, but on the darker Side <em>gm</em> is altogether uncompounded, and in all Places between the Sides the Composition is proportional to the distances of the Places from that obscurer Side <em>gm</em>. And having a Spectrum <em>pt</em> of such a Composition, we may try Experiments either in its stronger and less simple Light</p></div> </div>
