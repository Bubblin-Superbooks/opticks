In both Cases I view'd the same Objects, through the same Prism at the same distance from me, and in the same Situation. There was no difference, but in the Light by which the Objects were illuminated,  and which in one Case was simple, and in the other compound; and therefore, the distinct Vision in the former Case, and confused in the latter, could arise from nothing else than from that difference of the Lights. Which proves the whole Proposition.</p><p>And in these three Experiments it is farther very remarkable, that the Colour of homogeneal Light was never changed by the Refraction.</p></div> </div>
