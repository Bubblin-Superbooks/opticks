But when the Refraction of the second Prism was less than that of the first, the produced Axes of the Spectrums <em>tp</em> or <em>2t 2p</em> made by that Refraction  did cut the produced Axis of the Spectrum TP in the points <em>m</em> and <em>n</em>, a little beyond the Center of that white round Image S. Whence the proportion of the Line 3_t_T to the Line 3_p_P was a little greater than the Proportion of 2_t_T or 2_p_P, and this Proportion a little greater than that of <em>t</em>T to <em>p</em>P. Now when the Light of the Spectrum PT falls perpendicularly upon the Wall, those Lines 3_t_T, 3_p_P, and 2_t_T, and 2_p_P, and <em>t</em>T, <em>p</em>P, are the Tangents of the Refractions, and therefore by this Experiment the Proportions of the Tangents of the Refractions are obtained, from whence the Proportions of the Sines being derived, they come out equal, so far as</p></div> </div>
