<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Advertisement To This Fourth Edition</h3><p class="  start-chapter"><em>This new Edition of Sir</em> Isaac Newton's Opticks <em>is carefully printed from the Third Edition, as it was corrected by the Author's own Hand, and left before his Death with the Bookseller. Since Sir</em> Isaac's Lectiones Optic√¶, <em>which he publickly read in the University of</em> Cambridge <em>in the Years 1669, 1670, and 1671, are lately printed, it has been thought proper to make at the bottom of the Pages several Citations from thence, where may be found the Demonstrations, which the Author omitted in these</em> Opticks.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
