<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent stretch-last-line ">Actions upon the Rays at equal distances from the refracting Plane be equal, and at unequal ones either equal or unequal according to any rate whatever; that Motion of the Ray which is parallel to the refracting Plane, will suffer no Alteration by that Force; and that Motion which is perpendicular to it will be altered according to the rule of the foregoing Proposition. If therefore for the perpendicular velocity of the emerging Ray CN you write MC/NG × CG as above, then the perpendicular velocity of any other emerging Ray CE which was AD/EF × CF, will be equal to the square Root of CD_q_ + (<em>MCq/NGq</em> × CG_q_). And by squaring these Equals, and adding to them the Equals AD_q_ and MC_q_ - CD_q_, and dividing the Sums by the Equals CF_q_ + EF_q_ and CG_q_ + NG_q_, you will have <em>MCq/NGq</em> equal to <em>ADq/EFq</em>. Whence AD, the Sine of Incidence, is to EF the Sine of Refraction, as MC to NG, that is, in a given <em>ratio</em>. And</p></div> </div>
