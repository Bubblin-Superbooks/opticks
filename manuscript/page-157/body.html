For sometimes the Measures were a little greater, sometimes a little less, but seldom varied from one another above 1/3 of an Inch. For it was very difficult to define the Places of the Foci, without some little Errors. Now, if the Colours distant half  the Length of the Image, (measured at its Rectilinear Sides give 2-1/2 or 2-3/4 Difference of the distances of their Foci from the Lens, then the Colours distant the whole Length ought to give 5 or 5-1/2 Inches difference of those distances.)</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">But here it's to be noted, that I could not see the red to the full end of the Spectrum, but only to the Center</p></div> </div>
