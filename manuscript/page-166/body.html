As for instance, if the Sine of Incidence I, be to the Sine of Refraction R, as 20 to 31, and if D the Diameter of the Sphere, to which the Convex-side of the Glass is ground, be 100 Feet or 1200 Inches, and S the Semi-diameter of the Aperture be two Inches, the Diameter of the little Circle, (that is (<em>Rq × S cub.)/(Iq × D quad.</em>)) will be (31 × 31 × 8)/(20 × 20 × 1200 ×</p></div> </div>
