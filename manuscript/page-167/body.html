And therefore, the Error arising from the Spherical Figure of the Glass, is to the Error arising from the different Refrangibility of the Rays, as 961/72000000 to 4/55, that is as 1 to 5449; and therefore  being in comparison so very little, deserves not to be considered.)</p><p>![Fig. 27.](images/fig27-1.jpg Fig. 27.)</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">But you will say, if the Errors caused by the different Refrangibility be so very great, how comes it to pass, that Objects appear through Telescopes so distinct as they do?
