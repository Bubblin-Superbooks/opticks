If that Paper was perpendicular to that Light incident upon it, as 'tis represented in the posture DE, all the Colours upon it at O appeared white. But if the Paper being turned about an Axis parallel to the Prism, became very much inclined to the Light, as 'tis represented in the Positions <em>de</em> and <em>δε</em>; the same Light in the one case appeared yellow and red, in the other blue. Here one and the same part of the Light in one and the same place, according to the various Inclinations of the Paper, appeared in one case white, in another yellow or red, in a third blue, whilst the Confine of Light and shadow, and the Refractions of the Prism in all these cases remained the same.</p><p>![Fig. 2.](images/fig2-2.jpg Fig. 2.)</p><p>![Fig. 3.](images/fig3-2.jpg Fig. 3.)</p></div> </div>
