In the foregoing Experiment the several Intervals of the Teeth of the Comb do the Office of so many Prisms, every Interval producing the Ph√¶nomenon of one Prism. Whence instead of those Intervals using several Prisms, I try'd to compound Whiteness by mixing their Colours, and did it by using only three Prisms, as also by using only two as follows. Let two Prisms ABC and <em>abc</em>, [in <em>Fig.</em> 10.] whose refracting Angles B and <em>b</em> are equal, be so  placed parallel to one another, that the refracting Angle B of the one may touch the Angle <em>c</em> at the Base of the other, and their Planes CB and <em>cb</em>, at which the Rays emerge, may lie in Directum. Then let the Light trajected through them fall upon the Paper MN, distant about 8 or 12 Inches from the Prisms. And the Colours generated by the interior Limits B and <em>c</em> of the two Prisms, will be</p></div> </div>
