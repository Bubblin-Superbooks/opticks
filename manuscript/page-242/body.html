If the least refrangible Rays coming from the superior Prism take up the Space MT, the Rays of the same kind which come from the other Prism  ought to begin at T, and take up the remaining Space TN. If one sort of the Rays which have intermediate Degrees of Refrangibility, and come from the superior Prism be extended through the Space MQ, and another sort of those Rays through the Space MR, and a third sort of them through the Space MS, the same sorts of Rays coming from the lower Prism, ought to illuminate the remaining Spaces QN, RN, SN, respectively. And the same is to be understood of all the other sorts of Rays.

And therefore, since by this Mixture they</p></div> </div>
