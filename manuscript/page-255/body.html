But these are Curiosities of little or no moment to the understanding the Ph√¶nomena of Nature. For in all whites produced by Nature, there uses to be a mixture of all sorts of Rays, and by consequence a composition of all Colours.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">To give an instance of this Rule; suppose a Colour is compounded of these homogeneal Colours, of violet one part, of indigo one part, of blue two parts, of green three parts, of yellow five parts, of orange six parts, and of red ten parts.

Then I find Z the common center of gravity of these Circles, and through Z drawing the Line OY,</p></div> </div>
