<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">every where between <em>p</em> and <em>c</em>, many of these Rays will get through the Base, and be refracted; and the same is to be understood of the meanly refrangible Rays on either side of the Point <em>r</em>. Whence it follows, that the Base of the Prism must every where between <em>t</em> and B, by a total Reflexion of all sorts of Rays to the Eye, look white and bright. And every where between <em>p</em> and C, by reason of the Transmission of many Rays of every sort, look more pale, obscure, and dark. But at <em>r</em>, and in other Places between <em>p</em> and <em>t</em>, where all the more refrangible Rays are reflected to the Eye, and many of the less refrangible are transmitted, the Excess of the most refrangible in the reflected Light will tinge that Light with their Colour, which is violet and blue. And this happens by taking the Line C <em>prt</em> B any where between the Ends of the Prism HG and EI.</p></div> </div>
