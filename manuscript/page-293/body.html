For thence it's certain, that some Bodies reflect the more refrangible, others the less refrangible Rays more copiously.</p><p>And that this is not only a true reason of these  Colours, but even the only reason, may appear farther from this Consideration, that the Colour of homogeneal Light cannot be changed by the Reflexion of natural Bodies.</p><p>For if Bodies by Reflexion cannot in the least change the Colour of any one sort of Rays, they cannot appear colour'd by any other means than by reflecting those which either are of their own Colour, or which by mixture must produce it.</p></div> </div>
