And then by stopping any of the Colours <em>p</em>, <em>q</em>, <em>r</em>, <em>s</em>, <em>t</em>, at the Lens, I found that the same Colour would vanish at the Paper. So if the Purple <em>p</em> was stopp'd at the Lens, the Purple P upon the Paper would vanish, and the rest of the Colours would remain unalter'd, unless perhaps the blue, so far as some purple latent in it at the Lens might be separated from it by the following Refractions. And so by intercepting the green upon the Lens, the green R upon the Paper would vanish, and so</p></div> </div>
