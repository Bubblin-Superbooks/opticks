<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Ax. V.</h3><p class="  start-chapter"><em>The Sine of Incidence is either accurately or very nearly in a given Ratio to the Sine of Refraction.</em></p><p>Whence if that Proportion be known in any one Inclination of the incident Ray, 'tis known in all the Inclinations, and thereby the Refraction in all cases  of Incidence on the same refracting Body may be determined. Thus if the Refraction be made out of Air into Water, the Sine of Incidence of the red Light is to the Sine of its Refraction as 4 to 3. If out of Air into Glass, the Sines are as 17 to 11. In Light of other Colours the Sines have other Proportions: but the difference is so little that it need seldom be considered.</p></div> </div>
