<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Much after the same manner, if ACBD [in <em>Fig.</em> 3.] represent a Glass spherically convex on both sides (usually called a <em>Lens</em>, such as is a Burning-glass, or Spectacle-glass, or an Object-glass of a Telescope and it be required to know how Light falling upon it from any lucid point Q shall be refracted, let QM represent a Ray falling upon any point M of its first spherical Surface ACB, and by erecting a Perpendicular to the Glass at the point M, find the first refracted Ray MN by the Proportion of the Sines 17 to 11. Let that Ray in going out of the Glass be incident upon N, and then find the second refracted Ray N_q_ by the Proportion of the Sines 11 to 17. And after the same manner may the Refraction be found when the Lens is convex on one side and plane or concave on the other, or concave on both sides. )</p><p>![Fig. 3.](images/fig3-1.jpg Fig. 3.)</p></div> </div>
