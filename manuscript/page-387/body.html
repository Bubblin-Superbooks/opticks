And where by a due Refraction they are so much contracted, that the several Rings become narrower than to interfere with one another, they must appear distinct, and also white, if the constituent Colours be so much contracted as to be wholly co-incident. But on the other side, where the Orbit of every Ring is made broader by the farther unfolding of its Colours, it must interfere more with other Rings than before, and so become less distinct.</p><p>![Fig. 7.](images/fig7-3.jpg Fig. 7.)</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">To explain this a little farther, suppose the concentrick Circles AV, and BX, [in <em>Fig.</em> 7.] represent the red and violet of any Order, which, together with the intermediate Colours, constitute any one of these Rings. Now these being view'd through a Prism, the violet Circle BX, will, by a greater Refraction, be farther translated from its place than the red AV, and so  approach nearer to it on that side of the Circles,</p></div> </div>
