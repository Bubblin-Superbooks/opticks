And if the incident Rays flow from or towards several points Q, the reflected or refracted Rays shall flow from or towards so many other Points  <em>q</em> found by the same Rules. Whether the reflected and refracted Rays flow from or towards the Point <em>q</em> is easily known by the situation of that Point. For if that Point be on the same side of the reflecting or refracting Surface or Lens with the Point Q, and the incident Rays flow from the Point Q, the reflected flow towards the Point <em>q</em> and the refracted from it; and if the incident Rays flow towards Q, the reflected flow from <em>q</em>, and the refracted towards</p></div> </div>
