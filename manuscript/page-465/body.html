(for its transmission through the first Surface, is at the distance 0, and it is transmitted through both together, if their distance be infinitely little or much less than 1 the disposition to be transmitted at the distances 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,  &c. is to be accounted a return of the same disposition which the Ray first had at the distance 0, that is at its transmission through the first refracting Surface.
