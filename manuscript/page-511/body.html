And if this Proportion be found true by experience it will amount to a demonstration that these Rings (like those formed in thin Plates do depend on the thickness of the Glass. I procured therefore another concavo-convex Plate of Glass ground on both sides to the same Sphere with the former Plate. Its thickness was 5/62 Parts of an Inch; and the Diameters  of the three first bright Rings measured between the brightest Parts of their Orbits at the distance of six Feet from the Glass were 3·4-1/6·5-1/8· Inches. Now, the thickness of the other Glass being 1/4 of an Inch was to the thickness of this Glass as 1/4 to 5/62, that is as 31 to 10, or 310000000 to 100000000, and the Roots of these Numbers are 17607 and 10000, and in the Proportion of the first of these Roots to the second are the Diameters of the bright Rings made in this Observation by the thinner Glass,</p></div> </div>
