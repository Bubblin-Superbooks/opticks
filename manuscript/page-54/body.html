This Edge A_a_ being upward, is parallel both to the Horizon, and to the Parallel-Edges of the Paper DJ and HE, and the transverse Line FG is perpendicular to the Plane of the Window. And <em>de</em> represents the Image of the Paper seen by Refraction upwards in such manner, that the blue half DG is carried higher to <em>dg</em> than the  red half FE is to <em>fe</em>, and therefore suffers a greater Refraction. If the Edge of the refracting Angle be turned downward, the Image of the Paper will be refracted downward; suppose to δε, and the blue half will be refracted lower to δγ than the red half is to πε.</p></div> </div>
