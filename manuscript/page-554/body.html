Of these Hyperbola's one Asymptote is the line DE, and their other Asymptotes are parallel to the lines CA and CB. Let <em>rv</em> represent a line drawn any where upon the Paper parallel to the Asymptote DE, and let this line cross the right lines AC in <em>m</em>, and BC in <em>n</em>, and the six dark hyperbolical  lines in <em>p</em>, <em>q</em>, <em>r</em>; <em>s</em>, <em>t</em>, <em>v</em>; and</p></div> </div>
