For if Water be made warm in any pellucid Vessel emptied of Air, that Water in the <em>Vacuum</em> will bubble and boil as vehemently as it would in the open Air in a Vessel set upon the Fire till it conceives a much greater heat. For the weight of the incumbent Atmosphere keeps down the Vapours, and hinders the Water from boiling, until it grow much hotter than is requisite to make it boil <em>in vacuo</em>. Also a mixture of Tin and Lead being put upon a red hot Iron <em>in vacuo</em> emits a Fume and Flame, but the same Mixture in the open Air, by reason of the incumbent Atmosphere, does not so much as emit any Fume which can be perceived by Sight. In like manner the great weight of the Atmosphere which lies upon the Globe of the Sun may hinder Bodies there from rising up and going away from the Sun in the form of Vapours</p></div> </div>
