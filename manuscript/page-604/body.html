That part of the Resistance of a spherical Body which arises from the Attrition of the Parts of the Medium is very nearly as the Diameter, or, at the most, as the <em>Factum</em> of the Diameter, and the Velocity of the spherical Body together. And that part of the Resistance which arises from the <em>Vis inertiæ</em> of the Matter, is as the Square of that <em>Factum</em>. And by this difference the two sorts of Resistance may be distinguish'd from one another in any Medium; and these being distinguish'd, it will be found that almost all the Resistance of Bodies of a competent Magnitude moving in Air, Water, Quick-silver, and such like Fluids with a competent Velocity,</p></div> </div>
