The Rays of Light in going out of Glass into a <em>Vacuum</em>, are bent towards the Glass; and if they fall too obliquely on the <em>Vacuum</em>, they are bent backwards into the Glass, and totally reflected; and this Reflexion cannot be ascribed to the Resistance of an absolute <em>Vacuum</em>, but must be caused by the Power of the Glass attracting the Rays at their going out of it into the <em>Vacuum</em>, and bringing them back. For if the farther Surface of the Glass be moisten'd with Water or clear Oil, or liquid and clear Honey, the Rays which would otherwise be reflected will go into the Water, Oil, or Honey; and therefore are not reflected before they arrive at the farther Surface of the Glass, and begin to go out of it. If they go out of it into the Water, Oil, or Honey, they go on, because the Attraction of the Glass</p></div> </div>
