If two plane polish'd Plates of Glass (suppose two pieces of a polish'd Looking-glass be laid together, so that their sides be parallel and at a very small distance from one another, and then their lower edges be dipped into Water, the  Water will rise up between them. And the less the distance of the Glasses is, the greater will be the height to which the Water will rise. If the distance be about the hundredth part of an Inch, the Water will rise to the height of about an Inch; and if the distance be greater or less in any Proportion, the height will be reciprocally proportional to the distance very nearly. For the attractive Force of the Glasses is the same, whether the distance between them</p></div> </div>
