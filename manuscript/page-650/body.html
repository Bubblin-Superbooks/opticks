And if when the Drop is in motion you lift up that end of the Glasses where they meet, and towards which the Drop moves, the Drop will ascend between the Glasses, and therefore is attracted. And as you lift up the Glasses more and more, the Drop will ascend slower and slower, and at length rest, being then carried downward by its Weight, as much as upwards by the Attraction. And by this means you may know the Force by which the Drop is attracted at all distances from the Concourse of the Glasses.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Now by some Experiments of this kind, (made by Mr. <em>Hauksbee</em> it has been found that the Attraction is almost reciprocally in a duplicate Proportion of the distance of the middle of the Drop from the Concourse of the Glasses, <em>viz.</em> reciprocally in a simple Proportion, by reason of the spreading of the Drop, and its touching</p></div> </div>
