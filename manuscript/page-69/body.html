For so great was the inclination of the Rays to one another before Refraction. So then, the length of the Image PT would by the Rules of Vulgar Opticks subtend an Angle of half a Degree at the Prism, and by Consequence be equal to the breadth <em>vw</em>; and therefore the Image would be round. Thus it would be were the two Rays XLJT and YKHP, and all the rest which form the Image P_w_T_v_, alike refrangible.
