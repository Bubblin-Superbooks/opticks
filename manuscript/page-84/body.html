And you will find as before, that this Spectrum <em>pt</em> is inclined to that Spectrum PT, which the first Prism forms alone without the second; the blue ends P and <em>p</em> being farther distant from one another than the red ones T and <em>t</em>, and by consequence that the Rays which go to the blue end π of the Image πτ, and which therefore suffer the greatest Refraction in the first Prism, are again in the second Prism more refracted than the rest.</p><p>![Fig. 16.](images/fig16-1.jpg Fig. 16.)</p><p>![Fig. 17.](images/fig17-1.jpg Fig. 17.)</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The same thing I try'd also by letting the Sun's Light</p></div> </div>
