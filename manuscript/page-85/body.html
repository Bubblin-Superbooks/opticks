For if these two refracted Beams were again by a third Prism DH placed cross to the two first, refracted sideways, and the Spectrums thereby translated to some other part of the Wall of the Chamber, suppose the Spectrum PT to <em>pt</em> and the Spectrum MN to <em>mn</em>, these translated Spectrums <em>pt</em> and <em>mn</em> would not lie in one straight Line with their ends contiguous as before, but be broken off from one another and become parallel, the blue end <em>m</em> of the Image <em>mn</em> being by a greater Refraction translated</p></div> </div>
