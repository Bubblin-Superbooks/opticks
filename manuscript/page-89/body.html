In the mean while another Prism <em>abc</em> is to be fixed next after that hole <em>g</em>, to refract the trajected Light a second time. And these things being thus ordered, I marked the places M and N of the opposite Wall upon which the refracted Light fell, and found that whilst the two Boards and second Prism remained unmoved, those places by turning the first Prism about its Axis were changed perpetually. For when the lower part of the Light which fell upon the second Board <em>de</em> was cast through the hole <em>g</em>, it went to a lower place M on the Wall and when the higher part of that Light was cast through the same hole <em>g</em>, it went to a higher place N on the Wall, and when any intermediate part of the Light was cast through that hole, it went to some place on the Wall between M and N. The unchanged Position of the holes in the Boards,</p></div> </div>
